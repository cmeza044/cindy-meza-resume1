        <div class="subheading mb-5">Upsycling (Profession)</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Cindy Meza, and I'm fortunate enough to have found a career in the field of upcycling. Upcycling was something I did for the first time when I was about nine years old, and since I found that I loved it so much, it is now what I do for a living. Upcycling has provided me with the ability to be more creative with regard to my own sense of style in terms of clothes, and I've found that doing so has enabled me to do so in a better way (which I dearly love hehe). Anyways! It is something that I like doing with items that I come across that do not seem to be appreciated at this time, regardless of whether they come from other people or from thrift stores; I like to rehome them and give them a second opportunity at life. I believe that recycling materials that were once the waste of another person or a contribution from another is an excellent way to give things a deeper significance while also helping to take care of the environment. Not only does this help to give things a deeper meaning, but it also helps to take care of the environment. I would love to be able to share with you some of the many ways in which recycling is beneficial to the spirit as well as our environment, which, to tell you the truth, is in desperate need of more people to assist tend to our world. Those who do a lot of shopping and want to manufacture what they can't purchase by creating their own designs or simply clothing in general without the need to spend a considerable deal of money may benefit greatly from the practice of upcycling, which is a fantastic method to recycle garments. When it comes to the creation of new things, we need to give a greater amount of thought to what we release into the environment. Whether it be factories that manufacture sweatshops that include fast fashion industries or large businesses that don't clean up their aftermath, when it comes to producing new items that might end up possibly destroying our world, there are two types of factories that are to blame. I hope that by the time you finish reading this page, you will have a better understanding of why I do what I do and how you, too, may participate in u-cycling without having to leave the comfort of your own home. Because it may also be used for repurposing, upcycling has the potential to have enormous beneficial impacts on the natural environment. This makes it a very significant practice. According to the figures, 21% of Americans regularly reuse products like as garments, packaging, and commodities, which helps to minimize the demand for the creation of new goods and contributes to the preservation of the environment. Upcycling is good for the environment since it cuts down on the quantity of pollutants that are discharged into the air, land, and water during the manufacture of new things, and it also eliminates the need for any additional natural resources that may have been used. In addition to this, it helps reduce the amount of rubbish that would otherwise be transferred to landfills if the practice were not carried out. <br><br>

        Here are many ways how we could all use to recycle Paper is a kind of trash that includes paper sheets, newspapers, cardboard, and other printed materials that are often found in places like workplaces and educational institutions. Wood and water are the two primary components that go into making paper. Therefore, in order to reform the paper, it must first be recycled and then broken down into these two component pieces. The contaminants, such as ink and dirt, is removed using a filter. After being assembled, the paper is then soaked in warm water. This solution swiftly dismantles the paper into minute strands of cellulose fiber, resulting in a mushy product known as "PULP," which is essentially wet paper that has been lumped together. However, the paper has not yet been cleaned. After that, it is compelled to pass through a screen, where any leftover debris, such as bits of glue or plastic, are removed. The item is then sent to the D-inker, where it is submerged in a second bath consisting of air bubbles and a chemical that resembles soap and is referred to as "Surfactant." This bath serves to separate the paper from the ink. The ink is carried to the top by air bubbles, while the pulp sinks to the bottom of the container. This pulp is now free of contaminants and may be used in the production of fresh paper goods. Steel - Steel may be recycled indefinitely without suffering any degradation in the quality of its physical qualities. Steel is separated from other metals with the assistance of the liquid floating system and the high air-pressure system. After this, the steel is further reduced in size by hydraulic equipment, which applies a great amount of pressure to the material. Additionally, gas and plasma arches are used on occasion. After that, the steel is melted down and formed into new products such as cans, cutlery, automotive components, paper clips, and other similar goods. Glass is shattered and then broken down into very small fragments that are referred to as "cullet." These pieces are no more than five centimeters broad. Colored, clear, brown, and green glass fragments are separated from one another during the sorting process. Because color is permanent, it is essential to differentiate between the various hues. Silica is the primary component of glass, which is then melted down and shaped into a variety of different forms and products. When it comes to making aluminum useable again once it has been separated, there is not a whole lot that can be done with it, similar to the situation with steel. It is then chipped, rinsed, and shaped into various molds after being shredded, washed, and formed into chips in a big furnace. The materials are then transported to manufacturing facilities, where they undergo a second melting process and are rolled out into thin sheets before being cut, bent, and molded into new goods. Plastic is created by combining one of these six distinct kinds of chemicals: polyethylene terephthalate, high-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene and polystyrene. Because the molecular structure of each kind of plastic, which in turn affects the material's physical qualities, is unique from those of the other types of plastic, certain types of plastic are more easily recyclable than others. Because plastic is composed of long chains of carbon, certain types of plastic can be reshaped by being melted and reformed, while other types of plastic can be combined with fresh batches of plastic, and yet others can only be molded into diverse forms for a variety of applications. Conclusion There are certain products and materials, such as computers, batteries, light bulbs, and the like, that are difficult to recycle since a significant portion of them contain toxins. However, almost everything can be recycled, and garbage may be given a new form for re-usage. As a result, we are obligated to get rid of them in an accountable manner.<br><br>

        In addition to being a member of the Society of Environmental Journalists, I am also an instructor at the University of Riverside, where I teach Environmental Communication. I was one of the original founders of America Recycles Day and served as CEO of EnviroMedia for about five years. In addition, I am now serving as the 2021 Board Chair for the Austin LGBT Chamber of Commerce and was formerly a board member for Austin Habitat for Humanity. I was awarded the American Advertising Federation-Austin Silver Medal Award for outstanding contributions to advertising and furthering the industry's standards, creative excellence, and responsibility in areas of social concern. I received my Bachelor of Journalism in Public Relations from the University of California, Riverside. In addition, I am a winner of the American Advertising Federation-Austin Silver Medal Award. I am also the author of the upcoming book, Green-ish: How to Protect the Environment Without Hugging a Tree, which she is writing entirely outside in order to emphasize the point that the more time you spend outside, the more likely it is that you will protect the environment. I am also the author of this book. When you adopt a pet, even if you've had plenty of pets in the past and for many years, you get a greater appreciation for safeguarding all forms of animals, including snakes, scorpions, and other creepy, crawly creatures.
        Our culture is becoming more and more aware of the stress we place on the natural systems on which we depend, and it is vital that we develop creative solutions to make effective use of our resources in a manner that is beneficial to both our animals and our planet.
I have also partnered with local quality farmers and food producers to discover methods to put their off-spec food to good use. In addition, I have worked with grocery shops to make use of fruits and vegetables that may not sell in time for customers to have enough time to enjoy them. We are able to repurpose a variety of materials, such as pumpkins and apples, bread and cheese, and other very nutritious organ meats like bovine liver. We are continually seeking for new collaborations and applications in order to manufacture animal nutrition products that are of high quality and beneficial to the environment!</p>
